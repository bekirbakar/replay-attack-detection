# Replay Attack Detection

<p align="justify">
This repository contains initial experimental codes related to Replay Attack Detection studies conducted in 2018 as part of a full-time Researcher position at Bursa Technical University.

The work was done under the project supported by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) entitled "Audio Spoofing Attack Detection Under Adverse Condition for Trustworthy Speaker Verification" with the project number 115E916.
